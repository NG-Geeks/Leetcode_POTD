PROBLEM :: 2028. Find Missing Observations
You have observations of n + m 6-sided dice rolls with each face numbered from 1 to 6. n of the observations went missing, and you only have the observations of m rolls.
Fortunately, you have also calculated the average value of the n + m rolls.
You are given an integer array rolls of length m where rolls[i] is the value of the ith observation. You are also given the two integers mean and n.
Return an array of length n containing the missing observations such that the average value of the n + m rolls is exactly mean. 
If there are multiple valid answers, return any of them. If no such array exists, return an empty array.
The average value of a set of k numbers is the sum of the numbers divided by k.
Note that mean is an integer, so the sum of the n + m rolls should be divisible by n + m.
