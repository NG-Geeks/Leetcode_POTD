Problem :: 1652. Defuse the Bomb

You have a bomb to defuse, and your time is running out! Your informer will provide you with a circular array code of length of n and a key k.

To decrypt the code, you must replace every number. All the numbers are replaced simultaneously.

If k > 0, replace the ith number with the sum of the next k numbers.
If k < 0, replace the ith number with the sum of the previous k numbers.
If k == 0, replace the ith number with 0.
As code is circular, the next element of code[n-1] is code[0], and the previous element of code[0] is code[n-1].

Given the circular array code and an integer key k, return the decrypted code to defuse the bomb!

    vector<int> decrypt(vector<int>& code, int k) {
        vector<int> result(code.size(), 0);
        if (k == 0) return result;
        // Define the initial window and initial sum
        int start = 1, end = k, sum = 0;
        // If k < 0, the starting point will be end of the array.
        if (k < 0) {
            start = code.size() - abs(k);
            end = code.size() - 1;
        }
        for (int i = start; i <= end; i++) sum += code[i];
        // Scan through the code array as i moving to the right, update the
        // window sum.
        for (int i = 0; i < code.size(); i++) {
            result[i] = sum;
            sum -= code[start % code.size()];
            sum += code[(end + 1) % code.size()];
            start++;
            end++;
        }
        return result;
    }
};
