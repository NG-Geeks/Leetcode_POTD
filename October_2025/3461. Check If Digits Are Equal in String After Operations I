Problem :: 
3461. Check If Digits Are Equal in String After Operations I

You are given a string s consisting of digits. Perform the following operation repeatedly until the string has exactly two digits:

For each pair of consecutive digits in s, starting from the first digit, calculate a new digit as the sum of the two digits modulo 10.
Replace s with the sequence of newly calculated digits, maintaining the order in which they are computed.
Return true if the final two digits in s are the same; otherwise, return false.





Code

class Solution {
public:
    bool hasSameDigits(string s) {
        if(s.size()<2)return 0;
        while(s.size()>2){
            string t="";
            for(int i=0 ;i<s.size()-1 ; i++){
                t += ((s[i] + s[i+1]) %10) + '0';
            }
            s = t;
        }
        return s[0] == s[1];
    }
};
