PROBLEM :: 3370. Smallest Number With All Set Bits
You are given a positive number n.

Return the smallest number x greater than or equal to n, such that the binary representation of x contains only set bits


TIME COMPLEXITY :: O(LOG(N)
SPACE COMPLEXITY :: O(1)


CODE :: 
class Solution {
public:
    int smallestNumber(int n) {
        int ans =0 , i=0;
        while(n){
            ans += (1<<i);
            n>>=1;
            i++;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
