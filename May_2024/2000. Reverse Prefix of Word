Question ::  2000. Reverse Prefix of Word

Given a 0-indexed string word and a character ch, reverse the segment of word that starts at index 0 and ends at the index of the first occurrence of ch (inclusive). If the character ch does not exist in word, do nothing.

For example, if word = "abcdefd" and ch = "d", then you should reverse the segment that starts at 0 and ends at 3 (inclusive). The resulting string will be "dcbaefd".
Return the resulting string.

class Solution {
public:
    string reversePrefix(string word, char ch) {
        size_t x = word.find(ch);
        if(x == string::npos)return word;
        reverse(word.begin() , word.begin()+ x + 1);
        return word;
    }
};
